        <p>2. All orders accepted by the Company are deemed to include these Terms and Conditions of Sale.

        <p>9. Any date or time quoted to delivery is an estimate only. The Company will endeavor to affect delivery at the time or times required by the Customer.

        <p>10. The Company's obligation to deliver is discharged upon arrival of the Goods at the Customer's nominated delivery destination, nominated transport company (if the Customer pays the transport charge), nominated agent or the address appearing on the invoice whichever occurs first.
